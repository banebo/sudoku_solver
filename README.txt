This program is used for solving sudoku puzzles. It reads from a txt file which
contains the board. The values that are not written on the initial board are
written as 0 (zero). The numbers are separated with a space.

Board txt file example:

        4 5 0 3 0 1 0 0 6
        3 0 8 6 0 0 0 9 0
        6 7 0 4 2 8 3 0 0
        8 0 1 5 6 0 0 2 0
        2 4 5 9 8 7 1 0 0
        9 6 0 2 1 3 5 0 0

        1 8 3 7 4 9 6 5 2

That's all.
